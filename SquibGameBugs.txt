fix incorrect player names on steam
fix pause menu not showing up
fix not being able to host after being disconnected

NOTES from SHOOTER GAME
- Give instant feedback when possible when performing actions to minimize delayed input, such as animation or effects (due to server verified actions)
- ex. Start reload animation on client but only begin reload timer after server verifies logic

- NetMulticast basically doesnt exist in the SHOOTER GAME example


NOTES FROM SQUIBGAME EXPERIMENT
- Roll logic can probably be run on client instantly since the character already verifies player position
- The main issue is having incorrect actor rotation during a roll, causing big desync
- Possible solution: when server verifies roll, update actor rotation, character will handle rest
